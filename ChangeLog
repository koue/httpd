	* usr.sbin/httpd/: config.c, httpd.conf.5, httpd.h, parse.y,
	  server.c, server_fcgi.c: httpd(8): add support for setting custom
	  FastCGI parameters.

	  This commit extends the existing grammar by adding the param
	  option to the fastcgi directive: fastcgi param name value.

	  Example usage:   fastcgi param VAR1 hello   fastcgi param VAR2
	  world

	  With help and OK florian@ Rogue manpage bits, feel free to modify
	  them.

	* usr.sbin/httpd/: parse.y, server.c: Allow httpd(8) to start when
	  TLS is configured but a cert is not yet available.  Assuming a
	  httpd.conf based on /etc/examples/httpd.conf, httpd(8) will only
	  listen on port 80 and serve the acme-challenge directory for
	  acme-client(1).  The workflow to get a certificate then becomes
	  acme-client -vAD example.com && rcctl reload httpd Without the
	  need to edit the httpd.conf yet again. Once the cert is in place
	  and httpd is reloaded it starts to serve on port 443.

	* usr.sbin/httpd/parse.y: - odd condition/test in PF lexer   (and

	  This commit rectifies earlier change:

	      in the lex... even inside quotes, a \ followed by space or
	  tab should
	      expand to space or tab, and a \ followed by newline should be
	  ignored
	      (as a line continuation).  compatible with the needs of
	  hoststated

	  ifstated
	      (where one commonly does line continuations in strings).

	  passed in from the main process. It reads a file or creates a
	  directory index to send a response.  Additionally this process
	  handles fastcgi requests. It connects to AF_UNIX, AF_INET or

	* lib/libc/crypt/cryptutil.c: simplify crypt_checkpass. The API
	  promise is that this function doesn't use global data. The
	  simplest fix is to only check blowfish passwords, and implicitly

	  in one place, passwd, to verify the local user's password, so
	  this is probably acceptable.	Gives people a little more time to

	  serves static files, c) provides FastCGI support, and d) follows
	  common coding practices of OpenBSD.

	  It will neither support plugins, nor custom memory allocators,
	  EBCDIC support, PCRE or any other things that can be found
	  elsewhere.  httpd(8) is not intended to provide a fully-featured
	  replacement for nginx(8) or the Apache, but it will provide
	  enough functionality that is needed in the OpenBSD base system.
